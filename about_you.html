		<h3> <i> Biography <i> </h3>
		<p> Hello! My name is Christian Linhardt and I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas. 
			I am an accounting major and computer science minor and am pursuing a career in Technology Audit. 
			I love nature and hiking, my goal is to visit every national park.</p>
		
		<h3> <i> Tools </i> </h3>
		<p> To create this website I combined my knowledge of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tools. 
		HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" and is mainly used to outline the design of websites based on tags. </p>
		
		<p> CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet" and is used with HTML in order to design, style and properly display webpages.
			CSS is responsible for the webpage fonts, colors, spaces, margins, borders and much more! </p>
			
		<p> Finally, JavaScript is used to give websites proper functionality. For example, the sorting, adding, removing and editing
			functions of the to-do list all are possible through the use of the JavaScript coding language. </p>
